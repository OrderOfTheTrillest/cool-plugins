Guitar/Bass Amp Sims
--------------------

* [Ignite Amps SHB-1](https://www.igniteamps.com/#shb-1) - bass amp sim, pretty high gain, no built in cab sim. Sounds pretty good in general to me, great for a freebie. I prefer it over lots of paid alternatives - direct download, no signup
* [Neural Amp Modeler (NAM)](https://www.neuralampmodeler.com/) - loads amp model files. Model files can be created or downloaded from various places like [https://github.com/pelennor2170/NAM_models], quality varies from model to model but some are excellent. Can be a little resource heavy - direct download, no signup, open source

Guitar Pedals
-------------

__Note/Rant__ personally I feel like pedal sims are generally still less realistic than most other types of hardware modeled plugins. I think Neural Amp Modeler can do pedals, and from the little I think I understand about NAM's engine, this is where I'd say the most realistic free pedal sounds will live.

* [Mercuriall TSC](https://mercuriall.com/cms/details_freestuff) - one of the better tubescreamer plugins I've tried - direct download, no signup
* [Ignite Amps Pro F.E.T.](https://www.igniteamps.com/#profet) - harsh high gain distortion, sounds like a swarm of razors - direct download, no signup
* [Doom Plugs Bratwurst Fuzz](https://guitarandbassplugins.com/doomplugs/) - decent fuzz better than most fuzz emulations - direct download, no signup
* [Analog Obsession PEDALz](https://www.patreon.com/posts/pedalz-54136573) - a bunch of gross distortion units in a single gross unit for a whole bunch of gross distortion - direct download, no signup
* [Musical Entropy The Great Escape](https://www.musicalentropy.com/TheGreatEscape.html) - really nice and pretty feature rich tremelo effect, though I can't work out if/how it tempo syncs - direct download, no signup

Granular/Pitch/Time Effects
----------------

* [PaulXStretch](https://sonosaurus.com/paulxstretch/) - fun FFT stretch effect with some nifty extra effects. Not an easy plugin to use but great for making ambience - direct download, no signup
* [Soundhack ++bubbler](https://www.soundhack.com/freeware/) - bundle/direct download, no signup

Saturation Effects
------------------

* [Acustica Fire The Gold](https://www.acustica-audio.com/shop/products/FIRETHEGOLD) - standalone Gold preamp sim. Breaks up really nicely. I use this more than the Gold 5 pre plugin nowadays - product manager download, account required
* [Klanghelm IVGI](https://klanghelm.com/contents/products/IVGI.php) - direct download, no signup
* [Softube Saturation Knob](https://www.softube.com/saturationknob) - no frills, great sounding. Works inside softube modular if that's a consideration for you - product manager download, account required, ilok required

Synths
------

* [Surge XT](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/index.html) - a powerful semi-modular synth with a ton of features, xt version improves on the original in just about every way. Sounds pretty good to me but not top shelf. - direct download, no signup
* [discoDSP OB-Xd](https://www.discodsp.com/obxd/) - very decent sounding Oberheim-inspired synth, large feature set, a king's ransom worth of presets - direct download, no signup, has a Buy link that can be ignored (unless you want to support the devs, which is noble)

__Special mention__ for:

* [Vital](https://vital.audio/) - I don't personally like Vital much, but it's a powerful synth with a great feature set and plenty of fans, and so is worth mentioning. - requires account, free is one of several tiers that unlock additional features
