Plugins
=======

__NOT FREE__ plugins what is good IMO. Assume an account is required for all.

__NOTE__ processors that come with DAWs are often at least fine. I own most of these listed, otherwise using/used demos that have impressed me and I will own them eventually.

Compressors/limiters/dynamics
-----------------------------

* [Acustica El Rey](https://www.acustica-audio.com/shop/products/ELREY) - magnificent RCA BA-6A tube compressor, recently updated with stereo/ms version - product manager download
* [Acustica Aquamarine](https://www.acustica-audio.com/shop/products/AQUAMARINE) - enhanced Shadow Hills Mastering Compressor, comes with a separate program EQ plugin. Sounds fantastic - product manager download
* [Purple Audio MC77](https://www.plugin-alliance.com/en/products/purple_audio_mc_77.html) - 1176 style compressor, licensed hardware sim modelled by brainworx. Sounds crunchier to me than lots of other 1176 sims. Not for everything, sounds great as parallel compressor - product manager download, direct download available

Equalisers
----------

* [Tokyo Dawn Nova GE](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-nova-ge/) - dynamic EQ, additional features vs free version - direct or product manager download
* [Acustica Ruby](https://www.acustica-audio.com/shop/products/RUBY) - licensed sim of D.W. Fearn VT-4 and VT-5 - product manager download
* [Acustica Purple](https://www.acustica-audio.com/shop/products/PURPLE) - Pultec style eq bundle - product manager download
* [FabFilter Pro-Q](https://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-q-3-equalizer-plug-in) - ultra flexible and precise digital eq - bundle/individual download,

Channel Strips
--------------

* [Acustica Gold](https://www.acustica-audio.com/shop/products/GOLD) - modelled from a bunch of Neve gear. Favourite sounding plugin I've heard - product manager download
* [other Acustica channel strips](https://www.acustica-audio.com/shop) - In my opinion, if you want hardware modeled plugins its my first and probably only recommendation. High resource usage and large file size can be an issue (not uncommon for an Acustica suite to require more than 5GB). Some UA plugins sound comparable to me, otherwise for EQ especially I think they are the best - product manager download

Reverbs
-------

__Note__ that all these are algorithmic reverbs. For convolution reverbs I mostly just use the free Convology xt plugin or KiloHearts Convolver. Acustica Silver sounds amazing if your computer can run it happily.

* [Eventide Blackhole](https://www.eventideaudio.com/plug-ins/blackhole/) - plugin version of pedal of the same name, fun,  take on reverbs - direct download, ilok required
* [Soundtoys Superplate](https://www.soundtoys.com/product/superplate/) - great sounding emulations of 5 plate reverbs, resource heavy - direct/bundle download, ilok required
* [Valhalla VintageVerb](https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-vintage-verb/) - nice sounding multi-type reverb plugin, can cover most use cases - direct download
* [PSP 2445 EMT](https://www.pspaudioware.com/products/psp-2445-emt) - great sounding EMT 244/245 sim, I really like how its short reverbs sound - direct download, ilok required

Delays
------

* [Acustica Lemon](https://www.acustica-audio.com/shop/products/LEMON) - multi-tap delay with heaps of saturation effects modeled from numerous hardware units, sounds great and can do heaps. Resource heavy, though not too bad for Acustica - product manager download
* [Pulsar Echorec](https://pulsar.audio/echorec/) - fantastic sounding Binson Echorec sim, a bit resource heavy - direct download, ilok required
* [Audio Damage Dubstation 2](https://www.audiodamage.com/products/ad036-dubstation-2) - nice delay with a compact interface and still a bunch of flexibility, params work well together, moreso than lots of plugins with features taped to eachother - direct download
* [Unfiltered Audio Sandman Pro](https://www.unfilteredaudio.com/products/sandman-pro) - wild multi-type delay with great modulation capabilities - product manager download, direct download available.
* [Softube Tape Echoes](https://www.softube.com/tape-echoes) - good quality tape delay with a decent feature set, less flexible than some but does its thing really well - product manager download, ilok required
* [Arturia Delay ETERNITY](https://www.arturia.com/products/software-effects/delay-eternity/overview) - I've only demoed this but it's my favourite of the Arturia delays - product manager download

Chorus/Flanger/Phaser/Mod Effects
---------------------------------

* [Arturia Chorus DIMENSION-D](https://www.arturia.com/products/software-effects/chorus-dimension-d/overview) - Roland Dimension D sim, one of the few chorus effects I like - product manager download
* [Arturia Flanger BL-20](https://www.arturia.com/products/software-effects/flanger-bl-20/overview) - very nice sounding flanger effect, lots of options but its still a flanger - product manager download
* [Moog MF-1085 ClusterFlux](https://software.moogmusic.com/store/mf-108s) - wild chorus effect, lfo with the lot, not for everything but pretty flexible with lfo amount - direct download, ilok required (I think)

Distortions
-----------

* [Soundtoys Devil-Loc Deluxe](https://www.soundtoys.com/product/devil-loc-deluxe/) - technically its meant to be a compressor - direct/bundle download, ilok required
* [Glitchmachines Subvert](https://glitchmachines.com/products/subvert/) - digital modulated 3 band distortion - direct download
* [Output Thermal](https://output.com/products/thermal) - flexible semi modular distortion with a fun interface - product manager, direct download available

Bitcrushers
-----------

* [D16 Decimort2](https://d16.pl/decimort2) - somehow a bitcrusher and also high quality - direct download

Glitch/Buffer/Stutter Effects
-----------------------------

* [Melda MRhythmizer](https://www.meldaproduction.com/MRhythmizer) - good visual stutter effect with plenty of advanced capabilities - product manager download

Guitar/Bass Amp Sims
--------------------

* [Mercuriall SS-11X](https://www.igniteamps.com/#shb-1) - shouldn't cost so little given how good it sounds, also impressively low resource use - direct downloads, activations are non-transferable
* [NeuralDSP - all of them](https://neuraldsp.com/plugins) - I love Archetype Abassi, Rabea and Fortin NTS personally. Abassi I think has the nicest clean amp sim I've used. Most include various cab and pedal sims, and some have pretty wild features. Pedal sims are the best I've heard. Cab sims are well rounded and you can load your own IRs. Some can be very resource intense and they are pretty large, though not Acustica large - direct downloads, ilok required
* [Acustica Graphite](https://www.acustica-audio.com/shop/products/GRAPHITE) - Licensed model of GR Bass GR ONE series amps and AT 212 speaker cabinet. Personally my favourite bass amp plugin. Resource heavy, as per usual with Acustica - product manager download

Granular/Pitch/Time Effects
----------------

* [Unfiltered Audio Silo](https://www.unfilteredaudio.com/products/silo) - interesting and very capable granular effects - product manager, direct download available
* [Soundtoys Little AlterBoy](https://www.soundtoys.com/product/little-alterboy/) - great sounding pitch shifter/vocoder style effect with a nice drive - direct/bundle download, ilok required

Saturation Effects
------------------

* [Vertigo VSM-3](https://www.plugin-alliance.com/en/products/vertigo_vsm-3.html) - licensed model by brainworx, nice dual saturation unit - product manager, direct download available
* [Soundtoys Decapitator](https://www.soundtoys.com/product/decapitator/) - very flexible saturation/distortion unit. Covers a surprising amount of ground - direct/bundle download, ilok required

Lofi/Tape Effects
-------------

* [XLN RC-20 Retro Color](https://www.xlnaudio.com/products/addictive_fx/effect/rc-20_retro_color) - great sounding lo-fi multi-effects. Can sound like velcro on a bad gramophone or a broken atari - product manager download
* [Acustica Taupe](https://www.acustica-audio.com/shop/products/TAUPE) - saturation models from 40 tape machines, plus excellent eq, compressor and channel strip. I particularly like the compressor. Not really lofi but definitely tape. Fairly resource heavy but not too bad for Acustica. Very large - product manager download

Multi-effects
-------------

* [Unfiltered Audio BYOME](https://www.unfilteredaudio.com/collections/plug-ins/products/byome) - very capable multi-effect with excellent modulation, presets can also be used by TRIAD and LION. Can get resource heavy with lots of modules but is generally good in this area - product manager, direct download available
* [Cableguys ShaperBox 3](https://www.cableguys.com/shaperbox.html) - high quality modulated effects, can be resource heavy - direct download
* [Devious Machines Infiltrator 2](https://deviousmachines.com/product/infiltrator/) - like BYOME but sounds better to me, maybe more focus on sequences. I have only demoed this but it impressed me a lot - product manager/direct download

Synths
------

Probably obvious but I love modular synths. Resource usage for all of these listed depends on amount and type of modules used. Softube Modular is generally the hungriest, but you can max out your CPU with all of them if you try hard enough.

* [VCV Rack 2 Pro](https://vcvrack.com/) - vast Eurorack environment, too many possibilities to summarise, free standalone version is available, pro version includes vst/vst3 plugins and some additional vcv modules - direct download
* [Softube Modular](https://www.softube.com/modular) - less expansive but usually better sounding than vcv rack Eurorack simulator, resource heavy, less modules than vcv = less flexible, but still plenty to offer on top of an amazing sound engine - product manager download, ilok required
* [KiloHearts Phase Plant](https://kilohearts.com/products/phase_plant) - fantastic modular synth with huge capabilities, sound engine maybe just not quite as nice as Softube/Arturia/u-He/Synapse, but does everything pretty well (apart from microtuning) - product manager download
* [Native Instruments Reaktor](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths/reaktor-6/) - fun dsp environment with a quality sound engine, like max/pure data/etc but pretty, huge learning curve and I'm still a noob, but unlike me in max even noobs can make cool things here. Blocks are great too - product manager download

Because I love making lists and know that modular is not everyones cup of fish, here are some of the finest softsynths that you can use straight out of the box:

[Xfer Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum/), [Softube Model XX synths](https://www.softube.com/products/synths-and-keys), [Synapse Audio Dune 3](https://www.synapse-audio.com/dune3.html), [pretty much all u-He synths](https://u-he.com/products/#synths). I like [Pigments and some of the Arturia modeled synths](https://www.arturia.com/products#software-instruments,software-instruments-effects) but prefer others.
